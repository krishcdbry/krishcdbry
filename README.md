An Alpha Ninja! 

I am a highly unique and enthusiastic individual who embraces my inner geek and enjoys standing out from the crowd. My enthusiasm and love for all things "unordinary" is apparent in my personality and demeanor. If you meet me, you'll quickly see what I mean.

A goal-driven and self-taught leader with a passion for engineering and a love for tackling challenging problems. I am currently working at BharatPe, a $2.8 billion fintech company, where I have played a key role in its growth by building a solid team, delivering successful products, and fostering a positive company culture. 

Previously, I worked at Blinkit (formerly Grofers), an $800 million online grocery delivery company, where I led the engineering team and contributed to the company's growth. And also the founder of "GrowJs Community" 
 
I have a diverse skill set and extensive experience leading high-performing teams to success. Throughout my career, I have launched numerous successful products and made a significant impact on millions of lives. At the age of 19, I developed and launched a social network, e-commerce & community platforms. I have over 10+ years of experience in full-stack development, including the deployment and hosting of websites in various tech stacks. I have also launched several geeky apps on different platforms. I am a well-rounded professional with a strong track record of achievement
